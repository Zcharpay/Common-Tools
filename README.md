# Data exploration and analysis
This repo holds basic tools I use for exploring and analysing data. For some problems these are all I need, for other problems this is the first step in the process.

## In This Repository
**ANOVA.R** - ANOVA tests whether the means of different groups (treatments) are significantly different from each other, taking into account the variance of data within each group. This code steps through:
- Checking the assumptions required for ANOVA
- Doing the ANOVA
- Testing for which group(s) are significantly different if the ANOVA conclustion was to reject H0, using either Bonferroni or Tukey as appropriate

## Sample data used by the code templates
**ANOVAdata.txt** - sample of data used by ANOVA.R
