# Data exploration and analysis
This repo holds basic tools I use for exploring and analysing data. For some problems these are all I need, for other problems this is the first step in the process.

# In This Repository
ANOVA.R - ANOVA tests whether the means of different groups (treatments) are significantly different from each other, taking into account the variance of data within each group. This code steps through checking the assumptions required, doing the ANOVA, and testing for which group(s) are significantly different if the ANOVA conclustion was to reject H0.

# Sample data used by the code templates
